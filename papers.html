                    <p>Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting 10-40 million year old stars 1, but younger transiting planets have remained elusive. The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or that our view is blocked by the protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped/broken 2; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the observations of the transit- ing planet IRAS 04125+2902b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7 M⊙, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The host star harbors a nearly face-on (i ≃ 30◦) transitional disk 3 and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.7 R⊕ (0.96RJ ), and a 95%- confidence upper limit on its mass of 90M⊕ (0.3MJ ) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes commonly found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4′′, 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system are consistent with alignment except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear.</p>

                    <p>The youngest (<50 Myr) planets are vital to understand planet formation and early evolution. The 17 Myr system HIP 67522 is already known to host a giant (≃10R⊕) planet on a tight orbit. In their discovery paper, Rizzuto et al. reported a tentative single-transit detection of an additional planet in the system using TESS. Here, we report the discovery of HIP 67522c, a 7.9 R⊕ planet that matches with that single-transit event. We confirm the signal with ground-based multiwavelength photometry from Sinistro and MuSCAT4. At a period of 14.33 days, planet c is close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with b (6.96 days or 2.06:1). The light curve shows distortions during many of the transits, which are consistent with spot-crossing events and/or flares. Fewer stellar activity events are seen in the transits of planet b, suggesting that planet c is crossing a more active latitude. Such distortions, combined with systematics in the TESS light-curve extraction, likely explain why planet c was previously missed.</p>

                    <p>Stars are known to be more active when they are young, resulting in a strong correlation between
                        age and photometric variability. The amplitude variation between stars of a given age is large, but
                        the age-variability relation becomes strong over large groups of stars. We explore this relation using the excess photometric uncertainty in Gaia photometry (V arG, V arBP , and V arRP ) as a proxy for 
                        variability. The metrics follow a Skumanich-like relation, scaling as ≃ t−0.4. By calibrating against 
                        a set of associations with known ages, we show how V ar of population members can predict group 
                        ages within 10-20% for associations younger than ≃2.5 Gyr. In practice, age uncertainties are larger, 
                        primarily due to finite group size. The index is most useful at the youngest ages (<100 Myr), where 
                        the uncertainties are comparable to or better than derived from a color-magnitude diagram. The index 
                        is also widely available, easy to calculate, and can be used at intermediate ages where there are few or 
                        no pre- or post-main-sequence stars. We further show how V ar can be used to find new associations 
                        and test if a group of co-moving stars is a real co-eval population. We apply our methods on the Theia 
                        groups within 350 pc and find ≳90% are inconsistent with drawing stars from the field and ≃80% have 
                        variability ages consistent with those derived from the CMD. Our finding suggest the great majority of these groups contain real populations.</p>

                    <p>Young planets provide a window into the early stages and evolution of planetary systems. Ideal planets for such research are in coeval 
                        associations, where the parent population can precisely determine their ages. We describe a young association (MELANGE-3) in the Kepler field, which 
                        harbors two transiting planetary systems (KOI-3876 and Kepler-970). We identify MELANGE-3 by searching for kinematic and spatial overdensities around 
                        Kepler planet hosts with high levels of lithium. To determine the age and membership of MELANGE-3, we combine new high-resolution spectra with archival 
                        light curves, velocities, and astrometry of stars near KOI-3876 spatially and kinematically. We use the resulting rotation sequence, lithium levels, 
                        and color–magnitude diagram of candidate members to confirm the presence of a coeval 105 ± 10 Myr population. MELANGE-3 may be part of the recently 
                        identified Theia 316 stream. For the two exoplanet systems, we revise the stellar and planetary parameters, taking into account the newly determined age. 
                        Fitting the 4.5 yr Kepler light curves, we find that KOI-3876b is a 2.0 ± 0.1 R⊕ planet on a 19.58 day orbit, while Kepler-970 b is a 2.8 ± 0.2 R⊕ planet 
                        on a 16.73 day orbit. KOI-3876 was previously flagged as an eclipsing binary, which we rule out using radial velocities from APOGEE and statistically 
                        validate the signal as planetary in origin. Given its overlap with the Kepler field, MELANGE-3 is valuable for studies of spot evolution on year timescales, 
                        and both planets contribute to the growing work on transiting planets in young stellar associations.</p>

                        <p>Young (<500 Myr) planets are critical to studying how planets form and evolve. Among these young planetary systems, multi-planet configurations are particularly useful as they provide a means to control for variables within a system. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a young planetary system, TOI-1224. We show that the planet-host resides within a young population we denote as MELANGE-5 . By employing a range of age-dating methods -- isochrone fitting, lithium abundance analysis, gyrochronology, and Gaia excess variability -- we estimate the age of MELANGE-5 to be 210±27 Myr. MELANGE-5 is situated in close proximity to previously identified younger (80 -110 Myr) associations, Crius 221 and Theia 424/Volans-Carina, motivating further work to map out the group boundaries. In addition to a planet candidate detected by the TESS pipeline and alerted as a TESS Object of Interest, TOI-1224 b, we identify a second planet, TOI-1224 c, using custom search tools optimized for young stars (Notch and LOCoR). We find the planets are 2.10±0.09R⊕ and 2.88±0.10R⊕ and orbit their host star every 4.18 and 17.95 days, respectively. With their bright (K=9.1 mag), small (R∗=0.44R⊙), and cool (Teff =3326K) host star, these planets represent excellent candidates for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</p>

                        <p>The dispersed remnants of stellar nurseries, stellar associations, provide unparalleled samples of coeval stars critical for studies of stellar and planetary 
                            formation and evolution. The Carina Stellar Association is one of the closest stellar associations to Earth, and yet measurements of its age have varied from 13 to 45 Myr. 
                            We aim to update the age of Carina using the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) method. We obtain new measurements of the Li 6708 Å absorption feature in likely members using 
                            optical spectra from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on SOAR and NRES on LCO. We detect the depletion boundary at MK ≃ 6.8 (M5). This age is consistent within uncertainties 
                            across six different models, including those that account for magnetic fields and spots. We also estimate the age through analysis of the group's overall variability, and by 
                            comparing the association members' color–magnitude diagram to stellar evolutionary models using a Gaussian Mixture Model, recovering ages consistent with the LDB. Combining 
                            these age measures we obtain an age for the Carina association of 41 +3 -5 Myr. The resulting age agrees with the older end of previous age measurements and is consistent with 
                            the lithium depletion age for the neighboring Tucana-Horologium moving group.</p>

                        <p>We report the discovery and characterization of a nearby (∼85 pc), older (27 ± 3 Myr), distributed stellar population near Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC), 
                            initially identified by searching for stars comoving with a candidate transiting planet from TESS (HD 109833; TOI 1097). We determine the association membership using 
                            Gaia kinematics, color–magnitude information, and rotation periods of candidate members. We measure its age using isochrones, gyrochronology, and Li depletion. While 
                            the association is near known populations of LCC, we find that it is older than any previously found LCC subgroup (10–16 Myr), and distinct in both position and velocity. 
                            In addition to the candidate planets around HD 109833, the association contains four directly imaged planetary-mass companions around three stars, YSES-1, YSES-2, and 
                            HD 95086, all of which were previously assigned membership in the younger LCC. Using the Notch pipeline, we identify a second candidate transiting planet around HD 109833. 
                            We use a suite of ground-based follow-up observations to validate the two transit signals as planetary in nature. HD 109833 b and c join the small but growing population 
                            of <100 Myr transiting planets from TESS. HD 109833 has a rotation period and Li abundance indicative of a young age (≲100 Myr), but a position and velocity on the outskirts 
                            of the new population, lower Li levels than similar members, and a color–magnitude diagram position below model predictions for 27 Myr. So, we cannot reject the possibility 
                            that HD 109833 is a young field star coincidentally nearby the population.</p>

                        <p>Mature super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are predicted to be ≃Jovian radius when younger than 10 Myr. Thus, 
                            we expect to find 5-15R⊕ planets around young stars even if their older counterparts harbor none. We report the discovery 
                            and validation of TOI 1227 b, a 0.85±0.05RJ (9.5R⊕) planet transiting a very low-mass star (0.170±0.015M⊙) every 27.4 days. 
                            TOI 1227's kinematics and strong lithium absorption confirm it is a member of a previously discovered sub-group in the Lower 
                            Centaurus Crux OB association, which we designate the Musca group. We derive an age of 11±2 Myr for Musca, based on lithium, 
                            rotation, and the color-magnitude diagram of Musca members. The TESS data and ground-based followup show a deep (2.5%) transit. 
                            We use multiwavelength transit observations and radial velocities from the IGRINS spectrograph to validate the signal as planetary 
                            in nature, and we obtain an upper limit on the planet mass of ≃0.5MJ. Because such large planets are exceptionally rare around 
                            mature low-mass stars, we suggest that TOI 1227 b is still contracting and will eventually turn into one of the more common 
                            <5R⊕ planets.</p>
