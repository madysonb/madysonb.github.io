            <p>Abstract:</p>
            <p class='indent'>Mature super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are predicted to be ≃Jovian radius when younger than 10 Myr. Thus, 
                we expect to find 5-15R⊕ planets around young stars even if their older counterparts harbor none. We report the discovery 
                and validation of TOI 1227 b, a 0.85±0.05RJ (9.5R⊕) planet transiting a very low-mass star (0.170±0.015M⊙) every 27.4 days. 
                TOI 1227's kinematics and strong lithium absorption confirm it is a member of a previously discovered sub-group in the Lower 
                Centaurus Crux OB association, which we designate the Musca group. We derive an age of 11±2 Myr for Musca, based on lithium, 
                rotation, and the color-magnitude diagram of Musca members. The TESS data and ground-based followup show a deep (2.5%) transit. 
                We use multiwavelength transit observations and radial velocities from the IGRINS spectrograph to validate the signal as planetary 
                in nature, and we obtain an upper limit on the planet mass of ≃0.5MJ. Because such large planets are exceptionally rare around 
                mature low-mass stars, we suggest that TOI 1227 b is still contracting and will eventually turn into one of the more common 
                <5R⊕ planets.</p>

            <p class='two'>Abstract:</p>
            <p class='indent'>We describe a young association (MELANGE-2) in the Kepler field with a known planet candidate (KOI-3876.01) with signs of youth. 
                To better determine the age and membership of MELANGE-2, we combine archival light curves, velocities, astrometry, with new high-resolution 
                spectra of stars nearby KOI-3866.01 spatially and kinematically. The resulting rotation sequence, lithium levels, and color- magnitude diagram 
                of members are all an excellent match for the Pleiades, confirming the population is co-eval and providing an age estimate of 110±10 Myr. KOI-3876’s 
                observed properties are an excellent match to the group, confirming membership. MELANGE-2 may be part of the larger Theia 316 stream, also estimated 
                to be ≃108 Myr. For KOI-3876, we revise the stellar and planetary parameters of the system, taking into account the newly-determined age. We fit the 
                4.5 yr light curve from Kepler and find that KOI-3876.01 is a 2.0 ± 0.1R⊕ planet that orbits its star every 19.58 days on an eccentric (e > 0.2) orbit. 
                KOI-3876 was previously flagged as a likely eclipsing binary, but we rule this out using radial velocities from APOGEE and statistically validate the 
                signal as planetary in origin based on archival follow-up and its Kepler light curve. Given its overlap with the Kepler field, we expect MELANGE-2 to 
                be valuable for studies of spot evolution on timescales of years and KOI-3876 to be a piece of the growing work on transiting planets in young stellar 
                associations.</p>
