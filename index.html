            <p>I am a third-year graduate researcher and NSF Fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Physics and Astronomy. </p>

            <p> My current research revolves around the discovery of young (&#8818; 1000 Myr) exoplanets using TESS data and characterizing the planet, host star, and host star's 
            association. I work with <a class='one' href="https://andrewwmann.com/index.html">Dr. Andrew Mann and the Young World's Lab</a> at UNC, where our main goal 
            is to understand how planets evolve over time. My thesis project focuses on constraining planet occurance rates and calculating statistical comparisons of properties 
            of planets at different ages. I released my first first-author paper in 2022 about the characterization of <a class='one' href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac7b28/meta">two planets in a 105 Myr stellar association</a>, and 
            recently published an article in <a class='one' href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08123-3"><i>Nature</i> on a 3 Myr giant planet</a> in the presence of the disk that formed it. You can read more about my research <a class='one' href="papers.html">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p> I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for <a class="one" href="https://21s.comp110.com/">COMP110</a> for three years. I worked with ~40 other undergrads to serve over 600 introductory
            computer science students each semester. I provided 5-6 one-on-one office hours and 2 hours of group tutoring per week, in addition to helping 
            answer questions during lecture, developing course material, and being the primary point-of-contact for ~20 students. </p>

            <p>Since graduating undergrad, I have worked closely with the <a class="one" href="https://chancellorssciencescholars.unc.edu/">Chancellor's Science Scholars</a>. 
            I mentor a number of students, and using my TA experience, I was able to develop and teach a weekly 90-minute introductory computer science workshop for the 
            <a class="one" href="https://chancellorssciencescholars.unc.edu/about/summer-excelerator/">Chancellor's Science Scholars Summer EXCELerator</a> program in 2022 
            and 2023. While I was not able to teach the workshop in 2024 (you can read about why <a class="one" href="researchBlog.html">here</a>!), I helped develop the next itteration of the workshop for the new cohort of students. </p>
