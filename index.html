  <p>I am a Senior undergraduate researcher and teaching assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am majoring in 
  Astrophysics and Computer Science. </p>

  <p> My research revolves around the discovery of young exoplanets and the characterization of the planet, host star, and host star's 
  association. I work with Dr. Andrew Mann in the Young World's Lab at UNC. Our lab recently released a paper about the <a
  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09531">11 Myr TOI-1227 system</a>. I'm currently working on the characterization of an 110 Myr association 
  harboring two transiting planets, with a <a
  href="https://github.com/madysonb/KOI3876/blob/main/Paper/main.pdf">paper in prep</a>. 
  </p>

  <p> Additionally, I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for COMP110! I work with ~40 other undergrads to serve over 600 introductory
  computer science students every semester. I provide 5-6 one-on-one office hours and 2 hours of group tutoring per week in addition to helping 
  answer questions during lecture. </p>
