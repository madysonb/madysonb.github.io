            <p>I am a Senior undergraduate researcher and teaching assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am majoring in 
            Astrophysics and Computer Science. </p>

            <p> My research revolves around the discovery of young exoplanets and the characterization of the planet, host star, and host star's 
            association. I work with Dr. Andrew Mann in the Young World's Lab at UNC. Our lab recently released a paper about the <a class='one'
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09531">11-Myr TOI-1227 system</a>. I'm currently working on the characterization of an 110-Myr association 
            harboring two transiting planets, with a <a class='one'
            href="https://github.com/madysonb/KOI3876/blob/main/main.pdf">paper in prep</a>. 
            </p>

            <p> Additionally, I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for COMP110! I work with ~40 other undergrads to serve over 600 introductory
            computer science students every semester. I provide 5-6 one-on-one office hours and 2 hours of group tutoring per week, in addition to helping 
            answer questions during lecture, developing course material, and being the primary point-of-contact for ~20 students. </p>
